+ Use electromechanical mechanisms that cause hammers to strike against a ribbon and the paper.
- Impact Printers

+ May involve batch processing or intelligent sensors controlling the environment.
- Indirect interaction

+ Do not hit or impact a ribbon to print, but use heat, laser technology or photographic techniques to print output.
- Non-Impact Printers

+ Is the study of how humans interact with manmade things. It doesn’t have to involve computers, though when the man-made thing isn’t a computer, we typically use the term “ergonomics” or “human factors”.
- Usability

+ New users can accomplish goals easily and even more easily on future visits.
- Ease of Learning

+ Is a ball that can be rotated with the fingers to produces screen-cursor movement
- Trackball and spaceball

+ Is a thin, flat display device made up of any number of pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflector.
- Liquid crystal display (LCD)

+ Is the study of how humans interact with manmade things.
- Usability

+ Words encompass text, which helps convey the right amount of information to users.
- 1D: Words

+ Visual representations include typography, icons, and other graphics with which users interact.
- 2D: Visual Representation

+ Is an interface that is used to enter text information an electronic device.
- Text entry interface/ text entry device

+ Defined as the science concerned with the application of what we know about people, their abilities, characteristics, and limitations to the design of equipment
- Human Factor

+ Acquire brain signals, analyze them, and translate them into commands that are relayed to output devices that carry out desired actions.
- Brain-computer interfaces

+ Is a type of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)

+ Provides you with a range of commands or options in the form of a list or menu displayed in full screen, pop-up, pull-down, or drop-down.
- Menu-driven User Interface

+ Is speech recognition technology that allows people to interact with a computer or smartphone
- Voice User Interface (VUI)

+ It is also a positioning device and is used to describe a flat surface separate from the display, on which the user draws with a stylus.
- Tablet

+ Consists of a small that is used to steer the screen cursor around
- Joystick

+ Is the use of computer technology to create simulated environments.
- Virtual Reality (VR)

+ Includes sensory accessories such as controllers, as well as headsets, hand trackers, treadmills and, for creators, 3D cameras.
- Virtual Reality Hardware (VR Hardware)
