+ Systems that solves Business Problems (6 six)
- 1)	•	Transaction Processing System (TPS)
- 2)	•	Management Information System (MIS)
- 3)	•	Decision Support System (DSS)
- 4)	•	Expert Systems (ES)
- 5)    •	Office Automation (OA) System
- 6)	•	Communication Support System (CSS)


+ Is an IS application that captures and records information about the transactions that affect the organization.	It can respond to business transactions such as orders, timecards, or payments; or initiate transactions such as invoice, paychecks, or receipts. 
- Transaction Processing System (TPS)

When applied to executive managers, these systems are sometimes called executive information systems (EIS).
- Decision Support System (DSS)

+ Is an extension of DSS.	It is a programmed decision-making information system that captures and reproduces the knowledge and expertise of an expert problem solver or decision maker and then simulates the “thinking” or “actions” of that expert.
- Expert Systems (ES)

+ Is an IS application that supports systems that help employees create and share documents, including reports, proposals, and memos.
