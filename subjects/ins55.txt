- Transaction Processing System (TPS) 

+ Is an IS application that takes information captured by transaction processing systems and produces reports that management needs for planning and control.	It provides for management-oriented reporting. These reports are usually generated on a predetermined schedule and appear in a prearranged format. 
- Management Information System (MIS)

+ Is an IS application that supports systems that allow a user to explore the impact of available options or decisions. It provides its users with decision-oriented information whenever a decision-making situation arises. When applied to executive managers, these systems are sometimes called executive information systems (EIS).
- Decision Support System (DSS)

+ Is an extension of DSS.	It is a programmed decision-making information system that captures and reproduces the knowledge and expertise of an expert problem solver or decision maker and then simulates the “thinking” or “actions” of that expert.

+ Software products used to help develop analysis and design specifications and completed system components
- Tools

+ Strategies for completing specific system development activities. 
- Techniques

+ Systems analysts need to understand business organizations and how they operate, since they are solving problems for them. This is why the MIS or CIS majors are typically majors in a business degree.
- Business Knowledge and Skills

+ Analysts work with others to develop systems, including employees from various areas of the company and with other system developers. Therefore, people knowledge and skills are crucial.
- People Knowledge and Skills

- •	Enterprise resource planning (ERP)

+ Is the process of building, deploying, using, and updating an information system. It provides overall framework for managing systems development process.
- System development lifecycle (SDLC) 

+ Information System Development Phases
- Planning -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation  

+ initiates, ensures feasibility, plans, schedules, and obtains approval for project. It identifies the scope of the new system, ensure that the project is feasible, and develop a schedule, resource plan, and budget for the remainder of the project.
- Project planning 

+ understands business needs and processing requirements of the new system.
- Analysis 

+ defines solution system based on requirements and analyzed decisions.
- Design

+ constructs, tests, and installs a reliable information system with trained users ready to benefit as expected from the system.
- Implementation

+ keeps the system running productively initially and during the system’s lifetime.
- Support

+ The chief variations of SDLC include: (2 two)
- 1)	<strong>Predictive</strong> - assumes project can be planned out in advance.
- 2)	<strong>Adaptive</strong> – more flexible, assumes project cannot be planned out in advance.

+ The Traditional Predictive SDLC Approaches (2 two)
- Pure Waterfall Approach and Modified Waterfall Approach

+ The Newer Adaptive Approaches to the SDLC
- Spiral Model and Iterative Model

+ The waterfall model is a sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall).•	It assumes that project phases can be sequentially executed.•	First introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce
- Pure Waterfall Approach (Predictive SDLC)

+ •	The iterative waterfall model provides feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases, which is the main difference from the classical waterfall model. •	The feedback paths allow the phase to be reworked in which errors are committed and these changes are reflected in the later phases.
- Modified Waterfall Approach

+ •	Project cycles through development activities over and over until project is complete.•	Prototype created by end of each cycle. •	Focuses on mitigating risk.
- Spiral Model

+ •	Work activities are repeated.•	Each iteration refines previous result.•	Approach assumes no one gets it right the first time. •	There are a series of mini projects for each iteration.
- Iterative Model

+ The Unified Process (UP) Life Cycle (4 four)
- 1)	Inception
- 2)	Elaboration
- 3)	Construction
- 4)	Transition

+ Develop an approximate vision of the system, make the business case, define the scope, and produce rough estimates for cost and schedule.
- Inception

+ Refine the vision, identify and describe all requirements, finalize the scope, design and implement the core architecture and functions, resolve high risks, and produce realistic estimates for cost and schedule.
- Elaboration

+ Iteratively implement the remaining low-risk, predictable and easier elements and prepare for deployment.
- Construction

+ Complete the beta test and deployment so users have a working system and are ready to benefit as expected.
- Transition

+ A collection of guidelines that enables an analyst to complete an activity or task
- Techniques

+ These are software used to create models or components
- Tools

+ is abstract (separate) aspects of the real world. It comes in many forms like physical analogs, mathematical, and graphical.
