- use case

+ techniques are recommended for identifying use cases including?
- User Goal Technique, CRUD Technique, Event Decomposition Technique

+ This is an approach for identifying use cases in which an analyst talks to all users to get them to describe their goals in using the system.
- User Goal Technique

+ This an approach in which an analyst looks at each type of data and includes use cases that create the data, read or report on the data, update the data, and delete the data
- Crud Technique

+ This is the most comprehensive technique for identifying use cases and focuses on identifying the events to which a system must respond and then determining how the system must respond.
- Event Decomposition Technique 

+ Types of Events
- External, Temporal and State Event

+ an event that occurs outside the system, usually by an external agent or actor.
- External Event

+ an event that occurs as a result of reaching a point in time (time based event)
- Temporal Event

+ an event that occurs when something happens inside the system that triggers the need for processing
- State Event 

+ a catalogue of use cases that lists events in rows and key pieces of information about each event in columns.
- Event testable

+ Each column in the event table
- trigger, source, response, destination

+ a signal that tells the system that an event has occurred, either the arrival of data needing processing or a point in time.
- trigger

+ an external agent or actor that supplies data to the system
- source

+ an output, produced by the system, that goes to a destination
- response

+ are three levels of use case descriptions
- Brief Description, Intermediate Description, Fully Developed Description

+ Used for very simple use cases, Usually it is changed to an intermediate description or a fully developed description
- Brief Description

+ This technique is a joint effort between the analyst and the users.
- The Brainstorming Technique

- Generalization/specialization relationships

+ A class that does have objects is a ?
- concrete class

+ refers to a type of whole-part relationship between the aggregate (whole) and its components (parts), where the parts can exist separately and is represented by an open diamond.
- Aggregation

+ refers to whole-part relationships that are even stronger, where the parts, once associated, can no longer exist separately,
- Composition

+ CRUD is an acronym that refers to the following actions on an object (typically a data entity)?
- create,read,update and delete

+ is a very useful way to capture and display activities and permissions within a system.
- CRUD matrix

+ is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify and organize system requirements.
- use case

+ can help the development team identify and understand where errors may occur during a transaction so they can resolve them.
- use case document

+ typically written by business analysts and can be employed during several stages of software development,
- use cases

+ use case contains three essential elements:
- The actor: The system user, The goal: The final successful outcome that completes the process. The system: The processand steps taken to reach the end goal, including the necessary functional requirements and their anticipated behaviors.

- True or false: A complete use case will include one main or basic flow and various alternate flows.
- true

+ also known as an extending use case
- alternate flow,

+ describes normal variations to the basic flow as well as unusual situations.
- alternate flow

+ There are two different types of use cases:
- business use cases and system use cases.

+ is a more abstract description that's written in a technology-agnostic way, referring only to the business process being described and the actors that are involved in the activity.
- A business use case

+ is written with more detail than a business use case, referring to the specific processes that must happen in various parts of the system to reach the final user goal.
- a system use case

+ How to write a use case?
- When writing a use case, the design scope should be considered to identify all elements that lie within and outside the boundaries of the processes. Anything essential to the use case that lies outside its boundaries should be indicated with a supporting actor or by another use case. The design scope can be a specific system, a subsystem or the entire enterprise. Use cases that describe business processes are typically of the enterprise scope.

+ the three basic elements that make up a use
- actors, the system and the goal.

+ TRue or false: The use case is written using narrative language, describing the functional requirements of a system from the end user's perspective.
- true

+ True or false:  A use case model shows a view of the system from the user perspective,
- true

+ True or false:  Use case provides developers with a view of what the users want.
- true

+ True or false: always describes three things: an actor that initiates an event;
- true

+ is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity (a domain).
- domain model 

+ is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software. 
- domain model 

+ used to solve problems related to that domain.
- domain model 

+ It is generally a process to adapt as project unfolds by making alterations in plans.
- Iteration Planning

+ TRue or flase: Iteration Planning is generally process of just discussing and planning next cycle, phase, or iteration of software application that is in process of development.
- true

+ advised in some of cases where both risk and required investment are high. It can also be advised where problem domain is new or team is not experienced.
- Extension of this inception phase

+ also integrates foundation components of architecture of candidate and also provides an executable framework for explaining and simply elaborating use cases of system.
- early prototyping technique

+ results in architecture with complete framework and infrastructure for execution.
- Elaboration Iterations:

+ The essential result of late iteration in construction phase is that more functionality is added,
- Constrution Iterations

+ is generally responsible to migrate product into user community. Several projects use only one iteration to transition beta release
- Transition Iterations
